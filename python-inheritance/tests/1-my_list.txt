"""
Tests for MyList class which inherits from list.

This file contains tests to verify the behavior of the MyList class, specifically the
print_sorted method. It ensures that the method sorts the list in ascending order and
that the original list remains unchanged.

Test Cases:
1. Adding elements to the list and printing the sorted list.
2. Verifying that the original list remains unsorted after calling print_sorted.
