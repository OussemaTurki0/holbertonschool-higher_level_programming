Tests for inherits_from function.

This file contains tests to verify the behavior of the inherits_from function. It
ensures that the function correctly identifies if an object is an instance of a
class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class.

Test Cases:
1. Checking if a boolean is an instance of a class that inherited from int.
2. Checking if a boolean is not an instance of a class that inherited from bool.
3. Checking if a boolean is an instance of a class that inherited from object.
